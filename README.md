A browser-based **Draw & Guess** game.

Current version: **v2.3.13**

## What is ink-io?
ink-io is a drawing and guessing game that runs directly in the browser.  
Players draw, others guess. Simple concept, lots of room for improvement.

The project is still under active development. Many features are unfinished, experimental, or subject to change.
